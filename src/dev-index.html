                Welcome to the SF MusicTech Summit Slack Community and thanks for signing up!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you jump into chatting with other attendees and the SF MusicTech Summit team, we want to go over
                a few things...
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="explanation">
            <p>
                As a reminder, this community is only open to registered attendees of <em>Summit XVII</em> and will be
                active now
                through <em>November 24th</em> (two weeks after the Summit has ended).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we like what we see, and you like the experience, we will consider relaunching the <em>SF MusicTech
                Summit Slack</em> community for future events.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for us to try out Slack and continue to maintain a positive experience for all attendees,
                we’ve put together a list of Community Guidelines for the <em>SF MusicTech Summit Slack</em> community
                below.
                Please read these <strong>carefully</strong> before you get started!
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking forward to seeing what we can build in this community. Thanks to
                <a href="http://www.hydricmedia.com/">Hydric Media</a> for making it
                possible!

                    <p>
                        The SF MusicTech Summit is all about creating a positive environment to connect, do deals and
                        move the music and tech ecosystem forward. The SF MusicTech Summit Slack community should
                        maintain a similar vibe.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p>
                        Each member is limited to one account per attendee. Your user name should be your first and last
                        name ex: brian_zisk. The Admin team has the right to edit any user name that doesn’t meet these
                        guidelines.

                    <p>
                        Approach each interaction with curiosity over criticism. Be open minded and work towards productive discussion vs one-sided debates. Please be respectful of all viewpoints.

                        Respect the DM. This is a great way to have private discussions and make personal connections, but be sure your messages are welcome. If you are unsure, please ask an attendee before DMing.  If you are on the receiving end of unwanted and/or excessive DMs, please report to the “Admin” account via DM. Please keep in mind that everyone will have varying levels of activity in the community. If someone isn’t responding to you, don't take it personally, it may be better to try to connect in person at the event :)

All attendees will be invited to join the discussion, but any misuse of the channel will result in being removed from the SF MusicTech Summit Slack community.
