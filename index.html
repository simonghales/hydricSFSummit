                Welcome to the SF MusicTech Summit Slack Community and thanks for signing up!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you jump into chatting with other attendees and the SF MusicTech Summit team, we want to go over
                a few things...
            </p>

        <section class="explanation">
            <p>
                As a reminder, this community is only open to registered attendees of <em>Summit XVII</em> and will be active now
                through <em>November 24th</em> (two weeks after the Summit has ended).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we like what we see, and you like the experience, we will consider relaunching the <em>SF MusicTech
                Summit Slack</em> community for future events.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for us to try out Slack and continue to maintain a positive experience for all attendees,
                weâ€™ve put together a list of Community Guidelines for the <em>SF MusicTech Summit Slack</em> community below.
                Please read these <strong>carefully</strong> before you get started!
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking forward to seeing what we can build in this community. Thanks to <a href="">Hydric Media</a> for making it
                possible!
